# Hooks: add the qml files imported by Qml engine and all its imports

* Extract the main.qml file and all other qml files used in the application

* Add all the imports including the javascripts and folders

* Package all images with extensions ```.png```, ```.jpg```, ```.jpeg```,
```.tiff```, ```.gif```, ```.ico``` in qml source code

* The Qt import isn't that large at all it is just 533kb and it works just the  same way as QtQuick import works.
